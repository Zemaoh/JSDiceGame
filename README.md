# JSDiceGame
This project is a simple dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using the DOM (Document Object Model) to interact with the document elements and display results. Each time the page is reloaded, two dice are rolled (one for each player), and the player with the highest number wins. If both numbers are equal, the game ends in a draw.
